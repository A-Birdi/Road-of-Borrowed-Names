# Handoff

- Repository: `https://github.com/A-Birdi/Road-of-Borrowed-Names.git`
- Active task branch: `claude/stoic-sagan-n3jvgk` (base `main`; checkpoints are NOT on main)
- Spec: `SPECIFICATION.txt` (byte-identical copy of the brief)
- Deliverable: `index.html` at repo root, built by `node tools/build.mjs`.

## Architecture (src/, concatenated in `src/manifest.json` order)
- `core/` namespace + utils (RB.util, RB.bus).
- `lang/` Japanese core: RB.kana, RB.jp (ruby markup parse/render, deinflect,
  lookup), RB.lex (lexicon), RB.grammar, RB.answers (answer checking + feedback),
  RB.kanaLessons; `70_lookup_ext.js` (counters, names).
- `recog/` handwriting recognizer (KanjiVG-derived data, CC BY-SA 3.0; see
  docs/RECOGNITION.md). API: RB.recog.recognize / reference / strokeOrderFeedback.
- `audio/` Web Audio synth, sequencer, 33 songs, 44 sfx, local-only TTS (docs/AUDIO.md).
- `engine/` state+conditions, input, tiles, props, sprites, portraits, maps,
  mapkit, world, render, script DSL runner, save (IndexedDB slots), game
  controller, combat logic (95), test harness (99, inert unless enabled).
- `learn/` mastery scheduler, task generation.
- `ui/` UI core + lightbulb help + HUD, dialogue, title/slots, creation
  (prologue, placement, NG+), menus, handwriting pad, challenge runner, lessons,
  activities (orders/letters/signpost/history), combat UI + enemy art.
- `content/` 00_world (cast/places), 01_inkweaving (words, telegraph lines),
  ch1..ch6 chapters, zz_names (auto-registers names in lexicon).
- `atlas/` Unwritten Atlas (post-game expeditions) — by a worker.
- Docs: docs/STORY.md (bible), docs/CONTENT.md (authoring formats),
  docs/AGENT_COMMON.md, docs/LANGUAGE.md, docs/RECOGNITION.md, docs/AUDIO.md.

## State
- Engine, UI, saves, learning, combat, recognizer, language, audio: implemented.
- Chapter 1 (Reedwake) complete and validated (0 unknown tokens); browser story
  flow passes for all 4 companions × F/A profiles (tests/e2e/story_ch1.mjs).
- Chapters 2–6 and the Atlas are being written by parallel workers into
  src/content/ch2..ch6 and src/atlas (in progress at time of writing; check
  git log and validator output).

## Commands
- Build: `node tools/build.mjs`
- Content validation: `node tools/validate.mjs [--filter sg] [--unknown]`
- Unit tests: `node tests/run-unit.mjs [filter]`
- Browser: `node tests/e2e/story_ch1.mjs [F|E|I|A] [nao|mio|ren|suzu]`,
  `node tests/e2e/ui.mjs [filter]`, `node tests/e2e/audio.check.mjs`,
  screenshots: `node tests/e2e/shot.mjs out.png "<js>" [ms] [WxH]`.

## Next concrete actions
1. Integrate chapter workers' output; fix validator errors; add story-flow
   browser tests per chapter (pattern: tests/e2e/story_ch1.mjs).
2. Hub decorations for Atlas restoration flags (see docs/ATLAS.md when present).
3. Full-game flow test (ch1→ch6→ending→atlas) with RB.test auto mode.
4. Visual review of screenshots per region; polish.
5. Update REQUIREMENTS.md / VALIDATION.md with evidence; final report.

## Known issues / limits
- No human handwriting samples tested (synthetic + font-derived only).
- Playtime not measured.
- Japanese content has not been reviewed by a native speaker.
